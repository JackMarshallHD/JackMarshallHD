# Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub page.

My name is Jack Marshall, and I work in the games industry as a Technical Writer and Project Specialist at Boneloaf. I currently reside in the vibrant coastal city of Brighton, UK.

I have been working in games for a long time, and I have overseen the successful completion of numerous complex games and industry projects. In my spare time I also run [@tofu-testing](https://www.tofu-testing.com) carrying out production and testing for amazing indie games. 

I do not update my Github very often, but feel free to explore and don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities. Thank you for visiting!
